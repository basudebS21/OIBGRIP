          <b>Chittaranjan Das (5 November 1870 - 16 June 1925), popularly called Deshbandhu (Friend of the Nation), 
            was an Indian freedom fighter,
             political activist and 
             lawyer during the Indian Independence Movement 
             and founder-leader of the Swaraj Party in 
             undivided Bengal during the period of 
             British Colonial rule in India. 
             His name is abbreviated as C. R. Das.

             Chittaranjan Das was born in Bikrampur in a 
             well known Baidya"Das"family in the 
             village named "Telirbagh" which is situated 
             in present-day Tongibari upozila of 
             Munshiganj (Bikrampur) district of 
             Bangladesh on 5 November 1870

             Chittaranjan Das was actively involved 
             in the activities of Anushilan Samiti.
             When Pramatha Mitter organised the Samiti as
             its president to produce hundreds of young 
             firebrands who were ready to sacrifice their 
             lives for the cause of the Nation, 
              Chittaranjan became his associate.
              Anushilan Samiti was maintained by
              P. Mitter with the assistance of
              Chittaranjan Das (1894), 
              Haridas Bose (1895), 
              Suren Haldar (1900) and 
              Manabendra Nath Roy (1901).

              Chittaranjan went to Darjeeling to
               recuperate his health staying at
                Sir N. N. Sircar's house "Step Aside" in
                 May 1925.
